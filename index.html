      <h2 class="what">What are carbon dioxide emissions and their impact on the world?</h2>
      <h3 class="how">Carbon dioxide naturally occurs in the atmosphere as part of the earth's carbon cycle; however, human activities have begun altering this cycle by adding more CO2 to the atmosphere and by influencing the ability of natural sinks to remove and store CO2 from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide continues to be the lead greenhouse gas that is emitted through human activities. The primary contributor to CO2 emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels for the purpose of transportation.</h3>

          <h4 class="action-desc">Choosing to take more public transit or telecommuting as well as driving cars more efficiently can have a big impact on GHGs from personal travel. Communities can use smart growth principles to make it easy for people to walk, bike, or take shorter car trips. We can reduce GHGs from shipping by shifting some packages from long-haul trucks to more efficient rail or marine vessels. Truck drivers can better optimize their delivery routes.

          <h3 class="action-step">Technology</h3>
          <h4 class="action-desc">Weight reduction and improvements to engines and tires are just a few of the ways today's cars and trucks are becoming more fuel efficient. Some advanced technology vehicles—all electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles—are fuel efficient and emit zero harmful tailpipe emissions.</h4>
          <h3 class="action-step">Fuels</h3>
          <h4 class="action-desc">There are many lower carbon transportation fuels in the market today and more in development. These include biofuels, renewable natural gas, electricity, and hydrogen.</h4>
